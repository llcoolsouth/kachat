        <p class="latest-description">Strap in, folks. Today's episode gets a little racey. By that, I mean in this episode, we talk about the concept of race and ethnicity within the Cars universe, establishing that race does in fact exist in this universe, and along with it, racism. The implications of prejudice and hate based on race in a world full of anthropomorphized Cars are many, so let's go ahead and get into it. Oh, also we go on a five minute tangent dealing with a 13 second clip from Cars 2 that has nothing to do with our current topic. So, pretty par for the course, really.</p>

      <p class="previous-description">Get your jaws of life, people. Today, we're going inside the Cars themselves. Join us as we dissect these majestic creatures, disscussing how much of them is squishy, wondering where exactly all the that oil and gasoline that they drink goes, and creating a little Cars fan-fiction along the way. Be sure to bring your coveralls. This one's gonna get messy.</p>

      <p class="previous-description">On your marks, get set, go! The maiden voyage of The Ka-Chat has begun. You are legally obligated to break a bottle of champagne on your listening device. Sorry, I don't make the rules. Anyway, in this episode, John and Lucas, appropriately enough, talk about beginnings. Inappropriately enough, John says the phrase "Car Jizz" at least, like, 4 times. So uh... Sorry about that, I guess. Please listen to it anyway.</p>
