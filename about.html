      <p class="about-top">When John Bishop and Lucas Southworth met in the second grade, John said, "Hello, I am John. Would you like to do a podcast with me?" Lucas replied, "Of course, but only if it about the Disney/Pixar series of movies about talking cars that will exist in about four years." The rest, they say, is history. After 15 years of preparation, they released the first episode of The Ka-Chat. In this podcast, they explore the movies <em>Cars</em>, <em>Cars 2</em>, <em>Cars 3</em>, <em>Planes</em>, and <em>Planes 2: Fire and Rescue</em>, answering questions like "If there is a Car Pope, what is Car Catholicism like?", "Where do little baby Cars come from?", and "Why is the Cars 2 video game so good?" (Although this is a podcast about a series of children's movies, we use a fair amount profanity and discuss some mature topics, so use your judgement before you let your five year old listen to us ramble.)

        <p>Lucas is not a redhead. He has a ginger beard, but the hair on the top of his head is a dirty blonde. Now that that's out of the way, Lucas is also 22 years old. When he isn't making a podcast about a series of children's movies, he works in technical theatre and digital art, and in the best of times, a mix of the two. His favorite character in the Cars movies is Red the Firetruck.</p>

        <p class="john-align">Despite Lucas asking him a few times, John never sent Lucas his bio for the website, so Lucas had to take that into his own hands. Anyway, John is also 22, and does engineering or something? Who knows. He likes superhereos a whole bunch. His favorite character in the Cars movies is Mater, I guess?</p>

        <p>Not much is known about these two mysterious figures. They seem to have burning questions about these movies, and always get them to John and Lucas to answer on their podcast. (Lucas is dating a woman named Liz, and John is married to a woman named Lizzie. They ask us questions and we answer them in a section called "Questions from Liz." That's... the entire joke.)</p>
